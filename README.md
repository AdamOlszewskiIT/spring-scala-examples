# Using Spring with Scala

I have taken some guides from the [Spring.io website](https://spring.io/guides/) and modified them to use Scala instead of Java.

**I'm going to demonstrate this at [Spring I/O 2016](http://lanyrd.com/sdzkgm) in my talk: "Using Spring with Scala"**

Accompanying blog post [coming soon](http://bernhardwenzel.com).
