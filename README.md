# Using Spring with Scala

I have taken some guides from the [Spring.io website](https://spring.io/guides/) and modified them to use Scala instead of Java.

**I'm going to demonstrate this at [Spring I/O 2016](http://lanyrd.com/sdzkgm) in my talk: "Using Spring with Scala"**

Accompanying blog post can be found [here](http://bernhardwenzel.com/blog/2016/04/22/using-spring-with-scala/#examples-examples-examples).

## Build & run

You can follow the guide documentation. Basically, cd into `<project>/complete-scala` (the guide's Java version can be found under `project/complete-java`) and run `gradle run`.
