# Using Spring with Scala

Source code from my talk at Spring I/O 2016 in Barcelona.

I have taken some guides from the [Spring.io website](https://spring.io/guides/) and modified them to use Scala instead of Java.

Accompanying blog post can be found [here](http://bernhardwenzel.com/blog/2016/04/22/using-spring-with-scala).

## Build & run

You can follow the guide documentation. Basically, cd into `<project>/complete-scala` (the guide's Java version can be found under `project/complete-java`) and run `gradle run`.
